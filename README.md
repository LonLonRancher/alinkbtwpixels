Welcome to A Link Between Pixels!

Coming Soon ;)

Welcome to your number one source for researching and discussing video game theories! A Link Between Pixels is dedicated to keeping you up to date with new mysteries as well as providing historical info for newcomers. Created in 2018 by Lori Smith, ALBP was born somewhere along the trail of the comments under MatPat's Game Theory videos, late nights reading Hyrule Historia, and playing through Luigi's Mansion for the tenth time. ALBP was built with React, research, redbull, and love. I hope you enjoy using this site.
